### Customer Churn Prediction Project

Customer Churn Prediction Project
Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn within a business. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict customer churn based on various features such as age, subscription length, monthly bill, total usage, and more. The model uses historical customer data to make predictions and help businesses identify customers at risk of churning.

Project Structure
This project is structured as follows:

Data Collection: We collect historical customer data, which includes information about customers who have churned and those who have not.

Data Preprocessing: We clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Model Building: We build a machine learning model using various algorithms such as RandomForest, XGBoost, and deep learning models like neural networks.

Model Evaluation: We evaluate the models using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The ROC curve is also used for evaluation.

Hyperparameter Tuning: We fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance.

Logging and Monitoring: We use MLflow for model tracking and monitoring. Important metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are logged.

Cloud Deployment: The model is deployed to the Google Cloud Platform to make predictions accessible through a web app.

Automated Testing: Unit tests for the machine learning code are written and integrated into a continuous integration (CI) pipeline using GitHub Actions. This ensures tests are run automatically with every push to the repository.

Data Visualization: We visualize the data distribution and explore categorical column insights.
